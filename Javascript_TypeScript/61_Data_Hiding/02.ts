 /*
 
 The class AgriLoan implements the interface Loan. Hence, it is now binding on the class to include the property interest as its member.

On compiling, it will generate following JavaScript code.

//Generated by typescript 1.8.10
var AgriLoan = (function () {
   function AgriLoan(interest, rebate) {
      this.interest = interest;
      this.rebate = rebate;
   }
   return AgriLoan;
}());

var obj = new AgriLoan(10, 1);
console.log("Interest is : " + obj.interest + " Rebate is : " + obj.rebate);
The output of the above code is as follows âˆ’

Interest is : 10 Rebate is : 1
