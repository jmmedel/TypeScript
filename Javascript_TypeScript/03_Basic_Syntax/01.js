Your First TypeScript Code
Let us start with the traditional “Hello World” example −

*/
var message = "Hello World";
console.log(message);
/*

On compiling, it will generate following JavaScript code.

//Generated by typescript 1.8.10
var message = "Hello World";
console.log(message);
Line 1 declares a variable by the name message. Variables are a mechanism to store values in a program.

Line 2 prints the variable’s value to the prompt. Here, console refers to the terminal window. The function log () is used to display text on the screen.
