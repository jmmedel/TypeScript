Accessing values in Tuples
Tuple values are individually called items. Tuples are index based. This means that items in a tuple can be accessed using their corresponding numeric index. Tuple item’s index starts from zero and extends up to n-1(where n is the tuple’s size).

Syntax
tuple_name[index]
Example: Simple Tuple

*/

var mytuple = [10,"Hello"]; //create a  tuple 
console.log(mytuple[0]) 
console.log(mytuple[1])

/* 

In the above example, a tuple, mytuple, is declared. The tuple contains values of numeric and string types respectively.

On compiling, it will generate the same code in JavaScript.

Its output is as follows −

10 
Hello
