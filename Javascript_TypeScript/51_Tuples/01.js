TypeScript - Tuples
Advertisements
 Previous Page Next Page
At times, there might be a need to store a collection of values of varied types. Arrays will not serve this purpose. TypeScript gives us a data type called tuple that helps to achieve such a purpose.

It represents a heterogeneous collection of values. In other words, tuples enable storing multiple fields of different types. Tuples can also be passed as parameters to functions.

Syntax
var tuple_name = [value1,value2,value3,â€¦value n]
For Example
var mytuple = [10,"Hello"];


*/
var mytuple = [10, "Hello"];
/*

You can also declare an empty tuple in Typescript and choose to initialize it later.
var mytuple = [];
mytuple[0] = 120
mytuple[1] = 234

*/
