Updating Tuples
Tuples are mutable which means you can update or change the values of tuple elements.

Example

*/

var mytuple = [10,"Hello","World","typeScript"]; //create a  tuple 
console.log("Tuple value at index 0 "+mytuple[0]) 

//update a tuple element 
mytuple[0] = 121     
console.log("Tuple value at index 0 changed to   "+mytuple[0])


/*

On compiling, it will generate the same code in JavaScript.

The output of the above code is as follows âˆ’

Tuple value at index 0 10 
Tuple value at index 0 changed to 121
